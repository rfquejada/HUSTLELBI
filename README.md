# HUSTLELBI
Hustlelbi connects UPLB iskolars with opportunities to earn from fellow constituents searching for high-quality sideline work. In this platform, clients can post job offers publicly for freelancers to offer their services or directly hire someone based on a freelancer’s profile. Whether it’s a student needing that extra income or a client needing that extra help, Hustlelbi is a platform exclusive for UPLB only— offering secure sideline job connections with less hassle and more hustle! 

## Core Features
### Authentication
Users can sign up both as a client or as a freelancer. However, to provide exclusivity and security, this website is specific only for UPLB constituents. Therefore, user authentication using UP mail is needed to verify that a user is a bonafide member of the university. 
### Profile Customization (for freelancers)
Users who primarily sign up as freelancers can create a freelancer profile containing their personal and professional information. Aside from personal details, freelancers can provide information about usual service rates, service type, and usual availability.  
### Job Postings
Clients can post job offers publicly where information about a job is provided— the task description, job type, budget (optional), difficulty, requirements, and location. The budget detail is optional since clients can choose based on the service offers (with preferred rates) they receive from interested freelancers. 
### Make Direct Job Offers
When a client does not want to make a public job posting and instead wants to hire a specific freelancer based on their profile, they can directly send a job offer to the freelancer they want to hire. On the other hand, freelancers can easily accept or reject a job given similar details as when a job is publicly posted. 
### Verify Credibility
The website requires freelancers and clients to publicly display ratings and reviews from an accomplished job. These ratings contribute to a user's average rating— higher rating means higher credibility. Completed jobs are recorded and displayed as part of a user's associated history, which is displayed on their profile.
